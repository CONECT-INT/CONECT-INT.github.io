Within INT, many such components already exist, either carried by researchers in computational neurosciences or as themes strongly anchored in this field. A survey of the current situation reveals the existence of projects around different scales:

* dynamics and function of small and large-scale neural networks (Laurent Perrinet with Frédéric Chavane, David Hansel, Carl van Vreeswijk)

* Bayesian inference and predictive process models (Anna Montagnini, Emmanuel Daucé and Laurent Perrinet), reinforcement learning, action selection, decision (Andrea Brovelli and Emmanuel Daucé), link with attentional mechanisms (Guilhem Ibos)

* information theory and functional connectivity for the analysis of cognitive brain networks (Andrea Brovelli and Bruno Giordano)

* deep learning for data processing in acoustics and semantics (Bruno Giordano), deep learning + neuroimaging (in voice perception) (Charly Lamothe)

* brain anatomy, particularly as applied to the formation of cortical folding (Julien Lefèvre with Guillaume Auzias, Sylvain Takerkart and Olivier Coulon),

* the development of prognostic models of the evolution of certain pathologies (Lionel Velly, Sylvain Takerkart),

A structuring of these different components through a center (independent of existing and future teams) would be a major asset to reach a new stage in the creation of INT³.
