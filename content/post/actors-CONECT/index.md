Within the INT, many components of CONECT already exist, either carried by researchers in computational neurosciences or as themes strongly anchored in this field. A survey of the current situation reveals the existence of projects at different scales.

* from the cellular to the network level
  * deciphering the biophysical principles underlying robustness of neuronal activity using quantitative genotype-to-phenotype mapping strategies and realistic neuronal model databases (Jean-Marc **Goaillard** and Fabien Tell).
  * dynamics and function of small and large-scale neural networks (Laurent **Perrinet** with Frédéric Chavane, *David Hansel, Carl van Vreeswijk*)
* from networks to mesoscopic levels :
  * Bayesian inference and predictive process models (Anna **Montagnini**, Emmanuel Daucé and Laurent Perrinet), reinforcement learning, action selection, decision [Andrea Brovelli](../author/andrea-brovelli) and Emmanuel Daucé), link with attentional mechanisms (Guilhem Ibos)
  * information theory and functional connectivity for the analysis of cognitive brain networks (Andrea **Brovelli** and Bruno Giordano)
  * deep learning for data processing(Bruno **Giordano**), deep learning + neuroimaging (*in voice perception*) (Charly Lamothe) computational neuroscience and data processing in neuroinformatics (Sylvain Takerkart, NIT platform)
* at brain level
  * brain anatomy, particularly as applied to the formation of cortical folding (Julien Lefèvre with Guillaume Auzias, Sylvain Takerkart and Olivier **Coulon**),
  * the development of prognostic models of the evolution of certain pathologies (Lionel Velly, Sylvain **Takerkart**),
  * develop the collaboration of theoretical neurosciences with neuroinformatics, notably with the [NIT](http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/spip.php?page=plateform&equipe=CRISE&lang=fr) (Sylvain **Takerkart**, Guillaume Auzias)

A structuring of these different components through a center (independent of existing and future teams) would be a major asset to reach a new stage in the creation of INT³.
