- Press `S` key to view
- Hi, we are LP and NM and we look forward to start working with you on this project
- as part of the CENTURI summer school - and we would like to thank the organizers of the school...
- In this short presentation, we will present the challenges that we want to tackle and which we named...

##  CoNeCt: **Co**mputational **Ne**uroscience **C**en**t**er

- close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians
- share state-of-the-art (experimentalists well aware of theoretical approaches, experimental techniques for theoreticians)
- complementary in its purpose from neuroinformatics... {{% fragment %}}but distinct{{% /fragment %}}

{{< speaker_note >}}
- We are convinced that close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions. This is in fact a primary motivating force in establishing this center.
- However, for such collaborations to be effective, experimentalists must be well aware of the approaches and challenges in modeling while theoreticians must be well acquainted with the experimental techniques, their power and the challenges they present.
- CoNeCt has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities.

This approach is therefore complementary but distinct in its purpose from neuroinformatics (creation of tools for analyzing neuroscientific data) or artificial intelligence (creation of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the brain). The field of computational neuroscience is still young but its community is now structured in an autonomous community with strong interaction with the other branches of neuroscience. It is this autonomy that we want to foster at INT.

##  Objectives of CoNeCt

* to create a space for scientific discussion and animation

* train students and staff and attract young researchers:

* structuring the network of computational neurosciences at INT, on Timone, on AMU and in France & International


{{< speaker_note >}}
- lots of work - bottom approach so far
- no action taken
- lots of work - existence of top-down initiatives
