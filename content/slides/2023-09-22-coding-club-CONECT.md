[Optuna](https://optuna.org/) is a generic-purpose optimizer for hyperparameters. It combines a diversity of [modern search algorithms](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/10_key_features/003_efficient_optimization_algorithms.html) to optimize models in a black-box fashion, namely defining hyperparameters to optimize and an objective/cost function. Check the [tutorials](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html) for further information.
