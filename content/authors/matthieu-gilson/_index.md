How does the brain integrate information about the subject's environment with internal processes like motivation to produce behavior? What are the neuronal mechanisms and circuits that implement those functions? 
To address those questions, I develop models of neuronal networks to study their dynamics and emerging functions, at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. My continuing interest is on distributed representations and computations in neuronal networks. I use network models to interpret neuroimaging and electrophysiological data (spike trains, fMRI, EEG, MEG), in terms of brain communication at the macroscopic level and in terms of neuronal computations at the microscopic level.
