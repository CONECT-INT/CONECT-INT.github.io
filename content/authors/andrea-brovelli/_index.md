Brain Networks and Learning
Andrea Brovelli is a research director in cognitive computational neuroscience at CNRS and he coordinates the [BraiNets](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/recherche-int/equipes/brainets) team of the Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone at Aix-Marseille University. He investigates the neural and computational bases of goal-directed causal learning and adaptive behaviors. He uses the following approaches: i) Computational models of human learning and active inference; ii) Information theory for brain interactions analysis; iii) Multiscale neurophysiology and brain imaging (MUA, LFP, SEEG, MEG and fMRI).
