# PhD Student (2019-09 / 2024-02): A multiscale cortical model to account for orientation selectivity in natural-like stimulations

 * Aix-Marseille Université, Institut des Neurosciences de la Timone
 * Université de Montréal, Laboratoire des Neurosciences de la Vision

Hugo Ladret focuses on predictive coding, an influential brain theory that promises to account for the many seemingly disparate results neuroscientists have gathered over decades of experiments. Using neurobiology with a theory-driven approach, his experimental work deals about vision, and to find theoretical insights for neural network modelling.
