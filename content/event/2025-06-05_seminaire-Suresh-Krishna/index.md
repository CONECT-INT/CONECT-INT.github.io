title: '2025-06-05: CONECT seminar by Suresh Krishna'
subtitle: '"Peri-saccadic attention-shifts and visual information processing during active vision"'
summary: 'CONECT seminar by Suresh Krishna: "Peri-saccadic attention-shifts and visual information processing during active vision".'

* When: June 5th ***15:30 to 16:30*** 
* Where: Salle Laurent Vinay, _Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone_, Marseille, France.



During this CONECT seminar, [Suresh Krishna](http://m2b3.lab.mcgill.ca/) will  discuss our results from humans and monkeys performing visual tasks while making both instructed and free eye-movements. Each eye-movement necessitates compensatory remapping and attentional shifts (that are likely linked). I will discuss the surprisingly key role they play in active vision during goal-directed visual search, and also touch upon our recent work connecting remapping to peri-saccadic mislocalization. If time permits, I will also discuss an additional project involving our investigation of  a fascinating circuit for the optokinetic response.

Suresh Krishna directs the m2b3 lab at McGill ([http://m2b3.lab.mcgill.ca](http://m2b3.lab.mcgill.ca)). The lab focuses on vision, hearing, eye-movements and higher-mental functions via behavior studies, neurophysiology and computational function. Since recently, his research program has begun to include an applied and translational component, in collaboration with clinicians, with interests including strabismus, epilepsy and autonomic disorders.
