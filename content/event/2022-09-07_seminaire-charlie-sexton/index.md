title: '2022-09-07 : A CONECT seminar "Spike-timing dependent plasticity among multiple layers of motion-sensitive neurons: a feedforward mechanism for motion extrapolation" (Charlie Sexton)'

During this CONECT seminar, [Charlie Sexton](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/timing/lab/people#) will present his recent work on "**Spike-timing dependent plasticity among multiple layers of motion-sensitive neurons: a feedforward mechanism for motion extrapolation**":

More about Charlie: So far in my PhD I have looked at how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can shift feedforward connection strengths between levels of the visual hierarchy, such that higher levels encode moving objects further along their trajectory (as a mechanism for motion extrapolation). The project began with a paper by my supervisors, Hinze Hogendoorn and Tony Burkitt: https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/20/4428.abstract. I have been working on extending this model network to have 6 layers to see the combined effect of plasticity at several visual areas. I will attach my abstract for my ECVP talk here.
