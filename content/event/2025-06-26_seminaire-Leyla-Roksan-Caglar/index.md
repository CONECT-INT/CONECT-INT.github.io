* When: June 26th ***15:00 to 16:00*** 
* Where: Salle Laurent Vinay, _Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone_, Marseille, France.

During this CONECT seminar, [Leyla Roksan Caglar](https://www.leylaroksancaglar.com/) will present her work.

> Understanding how abstract information is represented in the brain - and how such representations
support efficient storage, retrieval, and generalization - has been a central challenge in cognitive
science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. In a series of studies, I will illustrate how my
research addresses these questions by 1) applying geometric and topological approaches to probe
the structure of neural representations, and 2) by using comparative approaches across minds,
brains, and machines. First, I will use a predictive encoding model and geometric analyses to show
that object-directed action representations (e.g. of tools) contain motor information in a
compositional manner that facilitates flexible retrieval. Then, I will use mathematical models of
similarity to investigate the structure, shape, and metricity of representational manifolds and their
congruency across behavioral and neural data. The results illustrate the importance between
representational form and function, as well as the learning processâ€™ representational constraints.
Building on this, I will discuss some ongoing work exploring the intimate link between
information-compression, generalization processes, and the shape of neural representations,
illustrating how representations are dynamically adapted to task performance. Using a comparative
lens across biological and artificial neural information processing systems and bridging
information theoretical approaches with topological data analysis, this work aspires to uncover
fundamental principles of generalization shared across humans, animals, and artificial neural
networks.
