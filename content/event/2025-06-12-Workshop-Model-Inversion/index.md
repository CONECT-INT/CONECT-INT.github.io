* Where: Salle Laurent Vinay, _Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone_, Marseille, France.

> Have you ever asked yourself how to find the neural model that best describes your data? What a good question! For complex models, no easy solution exists. Generally, this issue is referred to as "model inversion", and it often represents an ill-posed problem in data science, where no unique solution is at hand. However, recent advances in ML and AI are providing interesting tools that can be used to perform model inversion and fit neural models to brain data.
The aim of the workshop is to provide an overview of projects at INT and INS focusing on model inversion. Although technical, the workshop will try to provide an overview for experimentalists and those who are not familiar with model inversion techniques.
